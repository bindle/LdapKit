LDAP Kit
========

   LDAP Kit is a framework which provides an Objective-C interface for the
   OpenLDAP client libraries on Mac OS X and iOS. LDAP Kit manages the
   conversion between C data types and Objective-C classes, manages background
   threads for executing LDAP tasks, and manages memory allocated by OpenLDAP
   via NSAutoreleasePool objects.

      Note: Although this file uses some _markdown_ syntax, I chose to favor
            plain text readability over _markdown_ when formatting the text.
            The "Quick Start for Xcode 4" instructions were most affected
            by this consideration.

Quick Start for Xcode 4

   Prerequisite Reading

   * Xcode 4 User Guide: Orientation to Xcode


   Example Information
   -------------------

   For the sake of clarity, this tutorial uses the following information. Be
   sure to substitute information appropiate for your project and setup:

   Information                | 
   ---------------------------|----------------------------------------------
   Project Name               | Zebra
   App Name                   | Zebra.app
   Project File               | Zebra.xcodeproj
   Project Location           | /Users/zookeeper/Documents/Zebra/
   LDAP Kit Project File      | LdapKit.xcodeproj
   LDAP Kit Location          | /Users/zookeeper/Documents/LdapKit/
   iOS Ports Location (iOS)   | /Users/zookeeper/Documents/iOSPorts/
   iOS Ports Includes (iOS)   | /Users/zookeeper/Documents/iOSPorts/include
   Include Paths (iOS)        | ../LdapKit ../iOSPorts/include
   Include Paths (Mac OS X)   | ../LdapKit

   ** LDAP Kit expects the iOS Ports project directory to be in the same root **
   ** directory as the LDAP Kit project directory (for example                **
   ** `/Users/zookeeper/Documents/`).                                         **


   Add LDAP Kit Xcode project file
   -------------------------------

      1. Open Zebra.xcodeproj in Xcode.
      2. On the menubar, select "File" -> "Add Files to 'Zebra'..."
         A new dialog should appear.
      4. In the dialog, locate the LDAP Kit Xcode project (LdapKit.xcodeproj).
      5. Click the "Add" button. The Xcode project `LdapKit.xcodeproj` should
         appear in the "Project Navigator".


   Update Build Phases
   -------------------

      Open the Project Editor
      1. Display the "Project Navigator" in the "Navigator Area" of Xcode's
         main window (see "Xcode 4 User Guide").
      2. Click on the project icon in the project navigator (the project name
         is visible next to the project icon).  The project's build settings
         should appear in the "Edit Area" of Xcode's window.
      3. In "TARGETS" section, select the target which will use the LDAP Kit
         library.

      Update "Target Dependencies"
      1. Select the "Build Phases" tab from the project editor.
      2. Expand the "Target Dependencies" section.
      3. Click the "+" button under "Target Dependencies". A list of targets
         should appear.
      4. Locate the LDAP Kit target. The target should have an icon of a stone
         building. For a Mac OS X application, you would select `LdapKit`. For
         an iOS application, you would select `iLdapKit`.
      5. Click the "Add" button.

      Update "Link Binary With Libraries"
      1. Select the "Build Phases" tab from the project editor.
      2. Expand the "Link Binary With Libraries" section.
      3. Click the "+" button under "Link Binary With Libraries". A list of
         libraries should appear.
      4. Locate the LDAP Kit library. The target should have an icon of a stone
         building. For a Mac OS X application, you would select `libLdapKit.a`.
         For an iOS application, you would select `libiLdapKit.a`.
      5. Click the "Add" button.
      6. Repeat steps 1-5 with the following libraries:
         * libldap.a
         * liblber.a
         * libcrypto.a
         * libssl.a
         * libsasl2.a


   Update Build Settings
   ---------------------

      1. Select the "Build Settings" tab from the project editor.
      2. Search for the setting titled "Always Search User Paths". Change the
         value to "Yes". If the editor is displaying setting names instead of
         setting titles, search for "ALWAYS_SEARCH_USER_PATHS". If the editor
         if displaying setting definitions instead of setting values, change
         the definition to "YES".
      2. Search for the setting titled "User Header Search Paths". Add the
         relative include path to the LDAP Kit project directory. If building
         an iOS application, add the relative include path to the iOS Ports
         include directory. In this example, the relative include path is
         `../LdapKit` since both Zebra and iOS Ports are in the same parent
         directory. If the editor is displaying setting names instead of setting
         titles, search for "USER_HEADER_SEARCH_PATHS".


   The project Zebra should now be ready to compile the required static
   libraries and link to them.  The source for the iOS Ports packages will
   be downloaded the first time the packages are compiled.
